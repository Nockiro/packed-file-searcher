# packed-file-searcher
Search easily for files in multiple compressed archives

## What does it do?
The packed file searcher lets you add a bunch of files and search through them for a specific file.

## Why?
Have you ever tried to search inside a directory trough multiple zip files because you couldn't remember in which one you saved that one, really important file?
Well, I did and the windows search bar most of the times didn't work so it was easier to write a simple tool for it.

## Libraries used
Besides the standard .NET Libraries: [SevenZipSharp.dll](https://sevenzipsharp.codeplex.com/)
